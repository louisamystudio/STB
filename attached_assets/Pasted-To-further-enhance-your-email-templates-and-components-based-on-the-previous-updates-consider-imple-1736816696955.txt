To further enhance your email templates and components based on the previous updates, consider implementing the following improvements:

1. Validate Service Data
Make sure that the data you're using in scanToBIMServices is well-defined and properly validated. You can add PropTypes or TypeScript interfaces to ensure data integrity.

2. Improve Accessibility
Ensure that all interactive elements (like buttons) are accessible. For example, adding aria-labels to buttons can improve user experience for screen readers.

3. Performance Optimization
If the mapping of services in the MainContent component might grow large, consider using React's React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

Updated Code Example for MainContent.tsx
Here's an updated version of the MainContent component with accessibility in mind and memoization for performance:

// src/templates/email/components/MainContent.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { brandConfig } from '@/config/brand';
import { Service } from '@/types/services';
interface MainContentProps {
  services: Service[];
}
export const MainContent: React.FC<MainContentProps> = React.memo(({ services }) => (
  <tr>
    <td className="content" style={brandConfig.styles.content}>
      <h2 style={brandConfig.styles.sectionTitle}>
        Scan to BIM Services
      </h2>
      <p style={brandConfig.styles.text}>
        Transform your existing buildings into precise digital assets with our state-of-the-art 
        Scan to BIM services. Using advanced laser scanning technology, we create accurate 
        Building Information Models that empower your renovation, documentation, and facility 
        management needs.
      </p>
      
      <div className="service-grid" style={brandConfig.styles.serviceGrid}>
        {services.map(service => (
          <div key={service.id} className="service-item" style={brandConfig.styles.serviceItem}>
            <h3 style={brandConfig.styles.serviceTitle}>{service.title}</h3>
            <p style={brandConfig.styles.serviceDescription}>{service.description}</p>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </td>
  </tr>
));
4. Error Handling in Email Sending
You may also want to ensure robust error handling in your email sending logic, for instance, in emailService.ts. Here's how you could expand the error handling:

export const sendVerificationEmail = async (email: string, code: string) => {
  try {
    // ...existing code...
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error details:', {
      message: error.message,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      email: email
    });
    throw error; // Rethrow so that the caller can handle it (e.g., displaying an error message)
  }
};
5. Style Consistency
Lastly, check for style consistency across components. Ensure that styles declared in brandConfig are consistently used throughout your components for better brand identity.

Final Steps
After making these changes, run your build command to ensure everything works as expected:

npm run build
These additional measures will help maintain the quality and reliability of your email components, ensuring a better user experience. If you need further customization or specific functionality, feel free to ask!
