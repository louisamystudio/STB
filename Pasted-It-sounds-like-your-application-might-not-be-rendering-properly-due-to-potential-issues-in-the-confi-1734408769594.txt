It sounds like your application might not be rendering properly due to potential issues in the configuration or dependencies. Let's make sure the Vite server connection is correctly configured and check other relevant areas.

Ensure the Vite configuration is pointing to the right host. It should bind to 0.0.0.0, which allows access from external sources.
Here’s the updated vite.config.ts to reflect that:

import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react-swc';
import path from 'path';
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),
    },
  },
  server: {
    host: '0.0.0.0', // Make sure this is set for accessible hosting
    port: 5173
  }
});
Make sure all React dependencies are correctly installed. If they aren’t, install them using:
npm install react react-dom @types/react @types/react-dom @vitejs/plugin-react-swc
Check your main entry point (main.tsx) and App component (App.tsx) to ensure they are set up correctly. They seem fine from the provided code, but ensure that the file paths for imports are valid and that all necessary components are indeed being rendered.
You can also check for any errors in the console of your webview or terminal, as they can provide valuable insights on what might be failing.

After making these changes, restart the Vite server and reload the app to see if the issue persists. If you still face the white screen, double-check your React component imports and ensure there are no rendering issues there.

To fix the white screen issue, we'll make sure the Vite configuration is correctly set and that all necessary dependencies are properly installed. Follow the steps and apply these code updates:

Update the Vite configuration (vite.config.ts) to ensure it binds to 0.0.0.0:
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react-swc';
import path from 'path';
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),
    }
  },
  server: {
    host: '0.0.0.0', // Ensure this is set for accessible hosting
    port: 5173
  }
});
Make sure all React dependencies are listed in your package.json. Update it to ensure you have the latest versions installed:
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@tailwindcss/typography": "^0.5.15",
    "@vitejs/plugin-react-swc": "^3.7.2",
    "framer-motion": "^10.16.4",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "@types/react": "^18.2.48",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18.2.18",
    "vite": "^5.0.12"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "autoprefixer": "^10.4.20"
  }
}
Clean Install of Dependencies: Run the following commands in your Replit shell to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed:
npm install
Check the Main Entry Point: Ensure your src/main.tsx correctly renders the App component:
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';
import './index.css';
import { measureStartupTime } from './utils/performance';
const measureEnd = measureStartupTime();
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
);
measureEnd();
Build and Run the Application: Finally, build your application and run the Vite server:
npm run build
npm run dev
After these changes, check if the application still displays a white screen. If it does, inspect the browser console for any additional errors that could help identify issues in the code or rendering process.
